== 15 Min Blog

This is the new version of the 15 min Blog demonstration, by Ryan Bates.

Watch his screencast describing this code at http://rubyonrails.org/screencasts.

== Converting to Inherited Resources

The original Ryan Bates 15 min blog used bare bone Rails resources. With
added tests it had this ammount of code:

(master) $ rake stats
(in /Users/akitaonrails/Sites/rails/ryanb-15min-blog)
+----------------------+-------+-------+---------+---------+-----+-------+
| Name                 | Lines |   LOC | Classes | Methods | M/C | LOC/M |

This new branch replaces it with Jose Valim's inherited_resources gem. It
can be found here: http://wiki.github.com/josevalim/inherited_resources

Using its features, the resulting code has the same behavior as before (with
the same tests passing through perfectly) and the code stats come as this:

(inherited) $ rake stats
(in /Users/akitaonrails/Sites/rails/ryanb-15min-blog)
+----------------------+-------+-------+---------+---------+-----+-------+
| Name                 | Lines |   LOC | Classes | Methods | M/C | LOC/M |
+----------------------+-------+-------+---------+---------+-----+-------+
| Controllers          |    33 |    25 |       3 |       2 |   0 |    10 |
| Helpers              |     7 |     6 |       0 |       0 |   0 |     0 |

+----------------------+-------+-------+---------+---------+-----+-------+
  Code LOC: 38     Test LOC: 82     Code to Test Ratio: 1:2.2


In this particularly very simple application, we were able to reduce roughly
60% of the code, which is pretty impressive. This is possible because the
inherited_resources plugin removes a lot of redundancy from a Restful Rails
Controller, making it even more DRY.
